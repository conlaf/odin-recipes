Odin Recipes
This project is a simple recipe website created as part of the Foundations course on The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate fundamental HTML skills, including structuring content, creating lists, adding images, and linking between pages.

Project Overview
The website consists of a main index page that links to a few different recipes. Each recipe has its own dedicated page, complete with an image of the finished dish, an ingredient list, and step-by-step preparation instructions.

This project focuses purely on HTML to build the structure and content of the website. No CSS or JavaScript has been used for styling or interactivity, as the goal was to master the basics of HTML first.

Features
A main landing page (index.html) with links to all recipes.

Individual pages for each recipe.

Each recipe page includes:

The name of the dish.

An image of the dish.

A "Description" section.

An unordered list of ingredients.

An ordered list of preparation steps.

Technologies Used
HTML5

How to View
