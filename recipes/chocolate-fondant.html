        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Chocolate Fondant</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>125g of unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
                    <li>150g of sugar</li>
                    <li>125g of dark chocolate</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>35g of flour</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Crème Anglaise</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>150g of sugar</li>
                    <li>1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out</li>
                    <li>200ml of milk</li>
                    <li>200ml of cream</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with the crème anglaise. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and vanilla seeds until pale. Pour the milk and cream into a pan, add the vanilla pod and place on a low heat for 5 minutes to infuse</li>
                <li>Remove the vanilla pod and add the milk and cream mixture to the egg yolks and sugar. Whisk well, then return to a pan over a low heat. Cook until the mixture reaches a temperature of 85°C or coats the back of a spoon. Allow to cool and set aside to serve with the chocolate fondants</li>
                <li>Butter 6 ramekins and sprinkle the insides with the sugar. Preheat the oven to 200C°/Gas mark 6. Melt the butter and chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk the eggs and the 150g of sugar together for a minute or two in a bowl, then add the flour and the melted chocolate mixture</li>
                <li>Pour into the prepared ramekins and bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes - the centres should still be runny. Leave the chocolate fondants to rest for a minute or so before serving</li>
            </ol>
